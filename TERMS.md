VRConsole Terms of Service

Effective January 25, 2026

(© 2026 Lexi. All rights reserved.)

## TL;DR (Summary)

### Personal Project, Good Faith: 
VRConsole is a third-party utility tool for VRChat, created by a solo developer (Lexi) in good faith. It’s not an official VRChat product or a big commercial platform. Use it responsibly and at your own risk.

### Access & Changes: 
Using VRConsole is a privilege, not a right. Lexi can change features, limit access, or revoke your use of VRConsole at any time, for any reason (especially if you break these terms). Some advanced features may only be available if you support Lexi at higher Patreon tiers.

### No Refunds: 
Payments or donations (e.g. Patreon subscriptions) are non-refundable except if required by Patreon’s rules or applicable law. If your access is revoked due to breaking the rules or other issues (or if your internet or VRChat goes down), you won’t get a refund.

### Usage Rules: 
Don’t misuse VRConsole. No reverse engineering, tampering, or cheating. Don’t try to break the software or bypass its limits. Follow VRChat’s own Terms of Service and community rules while using VRConsole – you’re responsible for your conduct in VRChat. If you violate any rules, we can suspend or terminate your access.

### “As-Is” Warranty: 
VRConsole is provided “as is”. That means there’s no guarantee it will work perfectly or meet all your expectations. There are no warranties of any kind, and Lexi isn’t liable if something goes wrong (to the maximum extent allowed by law). Using VRConsole is at your own risk.

### Support: 
Lexi will try to help with issues (aiming to reply within about a week), but support is best-effort only. There’s no guaranteed service level or 24/7 support – remember, it’s just one person doing their best.

### Updates & API Calls: 
VRConsole may automatically update itself and will connect to certain services (like GitHub for updates, Patreon for confirming your subscription, and VRChat for its core functions). These connections are normal and necessary for VRConsole to work. The software will use your login credentials only for their intended purposes (logging into VRChat or verifying Patreon status) and will not share them with any other third parties.

### Account Security: 
Your VRChat and Patreon accounts remain under your control – VRConsole won’t ask for more info than it needs. Always keep your login details secure. If you suspect misuse, stop using VRConsole and secure your accounts.

### Eligibility: 
Only use VRConsole if it’s legal in your jurisdiction. You must be in a place where access to Patreon, VRChat, and GitHub is allowed. If your country or region bans or restricts these services (or if you’re on any applicable sanctions list), you aren’t allowed to use VRConsole. Also, you must meet the age requirements of VRChat (at least 13 years old) and Patreon (typically 18 or older) to use VRConsole.

### Dispute Resolution: 
If you have a serious dispute with Lexi regarding VRConsole, you agree to resolve it through binding arbitration (not in court). This means an arbitrator (a neutral third party) will decide, and you give up the right to a trial by jury and to join in class-action lawsuits.

### Closed Source & IP: 
VRConsole is a closed-source project. You’re granted a right to use it, but all code and content belong to Lexi. You can’t redistribute or copy it without permission.

By using VRConsole, you agree to all the terms below. Please read them carefully. The summary above is for convenience and is not a substitute for the full Terms of Service that follow.

---

# VRConsole Terms of Service (Full Agreement)
## 1. Acceptance of Terms

This Terms of Service (“Terms”) is a legal agreement between you (the “User” or “you”) and Lexi (“we,” “us,” or “the Developer”), the creator and owner of VRConsole. By downloading, installing, or using VRConsole in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use VRConsole. Using VRConsole means you accept these Terms.

## 2. Description of the Software

VRConsole is an unofficial third-party utility tool designed to work with the VRChat platform. It is developed and maintained by Lexi as a personal project for the VRChat community. VRConsole is not an official service or product of VRChat or any other company. It’s provided in good faith as-is, primarily through Lexi’s Patreon for supporters. While VRConsole adds functionality for end-users, it is not a commercial enterprise or SaaS platform – it’s a utility made by a solo developer. These Terms apply to all users of VRConsole worldwide, and we intend for them to be globally enforceable.

## 3. Changes to Features and Terms

### 3.1. Modification of Features: 
You understand that VRConsole is an evolving project. Lexi reserves the right to modify, add, or remove features of VRConsole at any time, for any reason. Features may be improved, changed, or discontinued without notice. Some features or updates might be released first or exclusively to users who have a certain Patreon support tier. We may also impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts of the software without notice or liability.


### 3.2. Changes to Terms: 
Lexi may update or revise these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice by posting the updated Terms (for example, on the official VRConsole page or via a Patreon update) and/or by other means. It’s your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. Continuing to use VRConsole after changes to the Terms are posted means you accept those changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using VRConsole.

## 4. Eligibility and User Requirements

### 4.1. Legal Use Only: 
You may only use VRConsole if it is legal to do so in your jurisdiction. By using VRConsole, you represent and warrant that your access to Patreon, VRChat, GitHub, and VRConsole is not prohibited by any law, regulation, or sanction applicable to you. You cannot use VRConsole if your country or region bans or restricts the use of Patreon, VRChat, or GitHub, or if you are on any government list that would prohibit your engagement with these services. You also confirm that you are not located in a country that is subject to comprehensive embargoes or sanctions (for example, countries under U.S. or U.N. trade sanctions), and that you are not on any list of sanctioned individuals. If at any point your status or location changes such that your use of VRConsole would violate applicable law, you must cease using VRConsole immediately.

### 4.2. Age Requirements: 
VRConsole is intended for users who are old enough to meet the minimum age requirements of VRChat and Patreon. VRChat requires users to be at least 13 years old (with certain features requiring 18+), and Patreon generally requires users to be adults (typically 18+ or with parental consent if allowed). By using VRConsole, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age and meet any age requirements of the platforms involved. If you are between 13 and the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use VRConsole under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. VRConsole is not intended for children under 13, and such individuals are not permitted to use the software.

### 4.3. VRChat and Third-Party Accounts: 
To use VRConsole effectively, you must have a valid VRChat account and (for certain features or access levels) an active Patreon subscription to Lexi’s page (for example, to access features gated by support tier). You are required to comply with VRChat’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and any other policies of VRChat while using VRConsole. Using VRConsole does not exempt you from VRChat’s rules – for example, if VRChat prohibits certain behavior or content, you must still follow those rules even when using VRConsole. Similarly, if you use Patreon to support VRConsole’s development, you must abide by Patreon’s Terms of Use and community guidelines. You are solely responsible for maintaining your own accounts with VRChat, Patreon, and any other relevant services, including keeping your login credentials secure. We have no responsibility for the security of your VRChat or Patreon accounts, and we cannot assist with recovery of those accounts beyond normal use of VRConsole’s functionality.

## 5. License and Intellectual Property

### 5.1. License Grant: 
Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any applicable Patreon subscription requirements, Lexi grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use VRConsole (in executable/object code form only) on a compatible device that you own or control. This license is for your personal, lawful, non-commercial use of VRConsole only. You may not use VRConsole for any commercial purpose (for example, you may not resell it or charge others for its use) without express prior written permission from Lexi.

### 5.2. Intellectual Property Ownership: 
VRConsole is a closed-source project. All software code, scripts, proprietary techniques, designs, logos, branding, and other intellectual property in or related to VRConsole are owned by Lexi and are protected by copyright and other applicable intellectual property laws and treaties. VRConsole © 2026 Lexi. All rights reserved. Nothing in these Terms transfers to you any ownership of intellectual property rights. You agree not to challenge Lexi’s intellectual property rights in VRConsole or remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices from the software.

### 5.3. Restrictions: You must not do (or attempt to do) any of the following with VRConsole:

- Reverse Engineer or Tamper: You may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of VRConsole, except to the limited extent that applicable law permits despite this limitation. Likewise, you must not modify, alter, or create any derivative works of VRConsole without permission. Any attempt to hack, crack, inject unauthorized code into, or otherwise tamper with VRConsole or its servers (if any) is strictly prohibited.

- Unauthorized Distribution: You may not copy, distribute, share, publish, upload, sell, rent, lease, or lend VRConsole or any portion of it to any other person, except as expressly allowed by Lexi. This means you can’t upload the software to another site or share it in a way not authorized by the developer. If VRConsole is provided to you through an official channel (like a Patreon post or a GitHub release authorized by Lexi), you should not redistribute it elsewhere.

- No Removal of Notices: You must not remove or obscure any proprietary notices (such as copyright or trademark symbols) or labels on or in VRConsole.

- Respect Closed-Source Nature: Because VRConsole is closed-source, you are not allowed to access or use its code for any purpose other than running the software as intended. You cannot incorporate any part of VRConsole into your own projects without permission.

- Compliance with Law and Policies: You must use VRConsole in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You may not use VRConsole for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. Additionally, you agree to follow any usage guidelines that Lexi provides (for example, if Lexi specifies certain settings or limits to prevent strain on VRChat’s systems, you should follow those).

- Violation of any of these restrictions is grounds for immediate termination of your license to use VRConsole (see Section 9 below), and may also be a violation of law (in which case Lexi reserves the right to pursue legal remedies).

## 6. Patreon Subscription and Payments

### 6.1. Free vs. Tiered Features: 
VRConsole is **not** offered as a free-to-use tool. All features and/or early access to updates might be gated behind various Patreon tiers. This means that if you choose to support Lexi on Patreon at a specified tier, you might gain access to additional functionality, priority support, or other perks. Lexi reserves the right to determine which features are available at which Patreon support level, and these may change over time. There is no guarantee that any particular feature will remain in a given tier permanently – features could be re-assigned to different tiers or made free/paid as the project evolves.

### 6.2. No Refunds Policy: 
All payments or donations made in relation to VRConsole (for example, Patreon subscriptions or one-time contributions) are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or by Patreon’s own refund policies. This means that if you decide to cancel your Patreon subscription or are dissatisfied with the software, Lexi is not obliged to provide a refund for any amounts already paid. Likewise, if your access to VRConsole is suspended or terminated due to a violation of these Terms or other misuse, you will not receive a refund for any payment made. The only exceptions to this no-refund policy are those mandated by law (such as certain consumer rights that might allow refunds in specific circumstances) or by Patreon’s terms (for instance, if Patreon’s rules allow a refund under certain conditions, those would apply). By making a payment or subscription, you acknowledge and accept this no-refunds condition.

### 6.3. Payment Processing: 
All payments for supporting VRConsole are handled through third-party platforms (e.g., Patreon). We do not directly process your credit card or financial information. Any payment information you provide is given to Patreon (or the relevant payment processor) and is subject to their terms and privacy policy. Lexi does not receive your credit card number or bank details from Patreon. We may receive information about your Patreon account such as your user name, email, and subscription tier/status to verify your access rights in VRConsole (see Privacy Policy for details on data usage).

### 6.4. Taxes: 
If any sales, use, VAT, or other taxes or duties apply to your purchase or subscription, those may be collected by Patreon or included in the charge. You are responsible for any taxes or government fees associated with your support of VRConsole, as required by your local laws.

## 7. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use

By using VRConsole, you agree to the following responsibilities and acceptable use terms:

### 7.1. Compliance with VRChat’s Terms: 
You must comply with VRChat’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, Code of Conduct, and any other rules established by VRChat while using VRConsole. VRConsole is designed to enhance or modify your experience in VRChat, but it does not exempt you from VRChat’s rules. For example, if VRChat prohibits certain content, behavior, cheating, or harassment, using those via VRConsole is equally prohibited. It is your responsibility to stay informed of VRChat’s policies. If VRChat updates its terms or features in a way that affects VRConsole’s permissibility or functionality, you should comply with the updated requirements. If you are banned or restricted by VRChat for any reason, you will also lose the ability to use VRConsole (and that will not entitle you to any refund from Lexi). We emphasize that VRConsole must be used at all times in a manner consistent with VRChat’s rules and the law.

### 7.2. No Misuse of the Software: 
You agree not to use VRConsole to harass others, to gain unfair advantage in VRChat, or in any way that could be considered cheating, exploitative, or disruptive to other users’ experience or to VRChat’s service. You will not use VRConsole to engage in any fraudulent activity, to misrepresent your identity, or to impersonate any person. If VRConsole has communication features or lets you input content, you will not use it to transmit any malware, viruses, or harmful code, nor to transmit unlawful, infringing, or offensive content. Basically, use VRConsole in good faith and with respect for others and the VRChat environment.

### 7.3. Account Security and Credentials: 
When using VRConsole, you will need to log in to your VRChat account and Patreon account through the software. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your own login credentials. VRConsole is designed to use your credentials only as needed for authentication (e.g., logging in to VRChat’s network or verifying your Patreon subscriber status). The software will not transmit your usernames/passwords to any unauthorized parties, and it will not store your passwords beyond what is necessary for you to use the service (see Privacy Policy for more). However, it’s still your job to keep your credentials safe: do not share your passwords, and be cautious if using VRConsole on a shared or public computer. If you believe your VRChat or Patreon account has been compromised, stop using VRConsole and secure your accounts immediately (e.g., change passwords, notify the platform). Lexi is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to safeguard your account information.

### 7.4. Only Intended Use: 
You may only use VRConsole for its intended purposes. Do not attempt to use it in unsupported ways. For example, do not try to use VRConsole with other programs or games in a manner it isn’t designed for, and do not use unauthorized plugins or mods on VRConsole itself. If VRConsole connects to certain official APIs (like VRChat’s API, Patreon’s API, GitHub, etc.), do not intercept or misuse those connections beyond what the software itself normally does. Any use of VRConsole outside of the scope of what is described in these Terms or the official documentation is not allowed.

### 7.5. Feedback: 
If you choose to provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas to Lexi about VRConsole (for example, bug reports or feature requests), you acknowledge that Lexi may use this feedback to improve or modify the software with no obligation to you. You will not be entitled to any compensation for such feedback, and any improvements or changes based on your feedback are owned by Lexi. Providing feedback is optional, but if you do, you give Lexi a license to use it freely.

## 8. Software Updates and Third-Party Services

### 8.1. Auto-Updates: 
VRConsole may include an auto-update mechanism or may prompt you when a new version is available. The software might periodically check for updates (for example, by contacting a GitHub repository or another update server) and may download and install updates automatically to ensure you have the latest features and security fixes. By using VRConsole, you consent to the software automatically installing updates (including bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, new versions, etc.). If you do not want auto-updates, your remedy is to discontinue use of VRConsole. Failing to use the latest version may impair functionality or security, and Lexi is not responsible for issues arising from outdated versions if you decline updates.

### 8.2. API Calls and External Services: VRConsole interacts with a few specific external services as part of its core functionality:

- GitHub: VRConsole may connect to GitHub (or a similar hosting service) to check for and download software updates or retrieve information (such as the latest release version). This is typically a read-only operation (fetching updates); no personal data about you is sent to GitHub by VRConsole beyond possibly standard technical information (like your IP address as part of the web request, and perhaps the version of VRConsole you’re using to check compatibility).

- Patreon: VRConsole will connect to Patreon’s API or website to verify your subscription status, Patreon user ID, or tier level. This is done to determine what features you have access to (for example, if a certain feature is available to “Gold” tier supporters, the software might verify that your Patreon account is indeed at that tier). VRConsole will use an authentication method to check this (OAuth tokens provided by Patreon when you link your account). Your Patreon login credentials are not stored by VRConsole; they are used to obtain a verification token or confirmation and then discarded. VRConsole will not share your Patreon information with any third party – it only uses it internally to validate your access rights.

- VRChat: VRConsole connects to VRChat’s platform and APIs to function (since it’s a VRChat utility). That means it will use your VRChat login (after you provide it) to fetch data such as your friends list, world info, or to send commands that control aspects of VRChat as per VRConsole’s features. VRConsole communicates with VRChat’s servers just as the official VRChat client does, but often through an alternate interface. All such communication is solely for providing VRConsole’s functions to you. VRConsole doesn’t route your VRChat data to any server other than VRChat’s official servers. Keep in mind that your use of VRConsole with VRChat is subject to VRChat’s own data handling and policies.

By using VRConsole, you consent to these external connections. These API calls are essential for VRConsole to work properly. We also assure you that no additional third-party services (besides GitHub, Patreon, and VRChat as listed) are contacted by VRConsole without your knowledge. VRConsole does not send your data to random servers or analytics platforms. **There is no advertising or tracking network integrated.** In short, VRConsole connects only to the services it needs to (updates, auth, VRChat) and nothing more. (For details on what data is exchanged in these calls and how it’s handled, see the Privacy Policy.)

## 9. Termination of Access

### 9.1. By the Developer (Lexi): 
Lexi reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to VRConsole at any time, for any reason, and at her sole discretion. This includes the ability to disable the software or your use of it remotely if possible, or to refuse to provide future updates to you. Reasons for termination may include (but are not limited to):

Violation of these Terms (any breach of the rules, restrictions, or obligations described here).

Engaging in cheating, harassment, or other misconduct on VRChat while using VRConsole.

Attempting to reverse engineer, hack, or distribute VRConsole illegally.

Any behavior that harms the community or the integrity of the software.

If required by law or if providing the software to you becomes illegal (for example, due to trade sanctions or a court order).

At Lexi’s discretion, if continued support for you is not feasible (for instance, if you are extremely abusive to the developer or other users).

Termination may be immediate and without prior notice. If you are terminated, you must stop using VRConsole and destroy any copies of it in your possession. You will not be entitled to any refund (per Section 6.2) in case of termination for cause. Lexi shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to VRConsole.

### 9.2. By the User: 
You are free to stop using VRConsole at any time. You may also uninstall the software at your discretion. If you have an active Patreon subscription and you no longer wish to use VRConsole or support its development, you are responsible for cancelling your Patreon subscription (through Patreon’s platform). Simply uninstalling VRConsole will not automatically cancel any payments on Patreon. It is your responsibility to manage that subscription if you choose to end it. These Terms will continue to apply to your past use of VRConsole even after you stop using it. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (such as intellectual property provisions, disclaimers, limitations of liability, arbitration, etc.) will remain in effect.

### 9.3. Feature or Service Sunset: 
Because VRConsole is a personal project, Lexi may decide at some point to discontinue the software entirely or cease development. If that happens, there may be an announcement (for example, on Patreon or a community channel) and the software may cease functioning (especially if VRChat updates render it incompatible). Users understand that there is no guarantee of perpetual availability of VRConsole. If the project is shut down, these Terms (aside from the license to use the software) will still apply in terms of protecting the developer’s rights (for example, intellectual property, no reverse engineering, no liability for the shutdown, etc.).

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties

VRCONSOLE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Lexi (the developer) disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, regarding VRConsole and your use of it. This includes, but is not limited to:

Merchantability: We do not warrant that VRConsole is fit for ordinary use or that it will perform in a way that meets merchantability standards.

Fitness for a Particular Purpose: We make no warranty that VRConsole will meet your specific needs or achieve any particular results that you are looking for. If you are using it for a specific purpose (for example, moderating a VRChat world or streaming), we do not guarantee it will fit that purpose or work as you intend.

Non-Infringement: We do not guarantee that VRConsole does not violate any intellectual property rights. (However, to our knowledge, VRConsole is original work. This disclaimer is standard legal protection.)

Accuracy and Reliability: Lexi does not warrant that the information, outputs, or results you get from using VRConsole will be accurate, reliable, or error-free. For example, if VRConsole displays certain data from VRChat, we don’t guarantee that data is up-to-date or correct (it depends on VRChat’s systems). Any metrics, logs, or outputs are provided as-is.

Availability and Uptime: We make no guarantee that VRConsole will be available at all times, that it will be uninterrupted, or that it will be free of delays or failures. Access interruptions, such as your internet not working, VRChat’s servers being down, Patreon’s API being unavailable, or any other outage, may prevent VRConsole from functioning. Such interruptions do not entitle you to any refund or compensation (see Section 6.2).

Security and Bug-Free Experience: While we strive to maintain the security of the software, we do not warrant that VRConsole is secure or free from vulnerabilities, bugs, viruses, or other harmful components. You accept that any software can have undiscovered issues. Use caution and understand you assume the risk for any damage to your system or loss of data that results from using VRConsole.

No Advice or Information Creates Warranty: If you receive any advice, suggestions, or information from Lexi or anyone else about VRConsole (for example, via social media, support channels, etc.), that does not create any warranty if it’s not explicitly stated in these Terms.

In summary, you assume all risk associated with using VRConsole. There are no promises that it will work perfectly or that it will not have errors. It is provided to you with the understanding that you use it at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so if you are in such a jurisdiction, some of the above disclaimers may not fully apply to you – in that case, Lexi’s warranties are limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Lexi be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages whatsoever arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) VRConsole, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion of liability includes, without limitation:

Loss of Data or Content: Any loss, deletion, or corruption of data or digital content that you experience through using VRConsole (for example, if VRConsole fails to save some configuration or if something goes wrong in VRChat due to VRConsole).

Loss of Revenue or Profits: Any loss of income, revenue, profits, or potential business opportunities arising from the use or performance of VRConsole. (For instance, if you were using VRConsole in a streamed event and it malfunctioned causing you reputational or financial loss, we are not liable.)

Downtime or Inaccessibility: Any inability to use VRConsole or VRChat for a period of time, and any impact that might have on you.

Device or Property Damage: Any damage to your computer, VR equipment, or other property that might result from using VRConsole or from any bugs/viruses transmitted via VRConsole.

Third-Party Conduct: Any act or omission of other users or third parties (for example, if someone uses VRConsole maliciously against you, or if VRChat’s behavior changes in a way that affects you negatively while using VRConsole).

In any case, Lexi’s total cumulative liability for any claims arising out of or relating to VRConsole or these Terms will not exceed the total amount (if any) you have paid to Lexi for the use of VRConsole in the past twelve (12) months (such as Patreon subscription fees specifically for VRConsole), or US $50, whichever is greater. If you have paid nothing, Lexi’s liability is $0. This limitation applies no matter what form of claim or action (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, breach of statutory duty, or any other legal theory).

Exceptions: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities. For example, in some places, you cannot exclude liability for personal injury or death caused by negligence, or for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Also, some countries do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages. If you reside in a jurisdiction that disallows some of these limitations, then to the extent disallowed, those limitations will not apply to you. However, all other limitations will apply. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited by law.

You acknowledge and agree that the disclaimers and limitations of liability in these Terms are a crucial part of the agreement and that Lexi would not have released VRConsole to you without such disclaimers and limitations.

## 12. Customer Support

### 12.1. Best-Effort Support: 
VRConsole is provided essentially as an indie project, and any customer support is offered on a best-effort basis. Lexi may choose to provide help, troubleshooting advice, bug fixes, or other support through channels such as Patreon posts, community Discord/Chat (if one exists), email, or other forums. However, support is not guaranteed. As a solo developer, Lexi might not always be available to assist immediately. Please be patient and courteous when seeking support.

### 12.2. Non-Binding 1-Week SLA Target: 
While not legally binding, Lexi aims to respond to support requests (especially from Patreon supporters) within approximately one week of receiving them. This is a target, not a strict guarantee. Response times can vary based on the developer’s personal workload, availability, and the complexity of the issue. Delays may occur, especially if Lexi is busy or if the project has many inquiries at once. There is no formal Service Level Agreement (SLA) – the one-week timeframe is a guideline to set expectations, not a contractual obligation.

### 12.3. Limited Scope of Support: 
Support may include answering questions on how to use VRConsole, investigating bugs, and releasing patches or updates for issues that significantly impair functionality. However, Lexi cannot guarantee that every bug will be fixed or that feature requests will be implemented. Additionally, Lexi cannot provide support for general VRChat issues or issues caused by third-party platforms (for example, if VRChat’s servers are down or Patreon’s API is not responding, those are outside of VRConsole’s control).

### 12.4. No 24/7 or Emergency Support: 
There is no 24/7 support line or emergency contact for VRConsole. Do not expect immediate responses, especially outside normal waking hours for Lexi’s time zone. VRConsole is not a mission-critical enterprise service, and it’s provided with the understanding that response times and support resources are limited.

### 12.5. Community Help: 
You may find help from other users in the community (if a community exists on Discord, forums, etc.), but remember that advice from other users is not official and is provided at their discretion. Lexi is not responsible for any guidance given by third parties about VRConsole.

In summary, Lexi will do her best to support VRConsole users, but there is no formal commitment to support. Your use of VRConsole should be in recognition of this fact.

## 13. Privacy

Your privacy is important. VRConsole’s use of your data is very limited and is described in detail in the Privacy Policy (which is a separate document, but is incorporated into these Terms by reference). In short, VRConsole will only collect and use personal data as necessary for it to function – such as your login credentials (which are not stored, only passed through to log you in), and info about your Patreon tier to verify access. VRConsole does not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or any unrelated purposes. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to the practices outlined in the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with how the Privacy Policy describes data handling, do not use VRConsole.

Please review the Privacy Policy to understand what data VRConsole may collect and how it is used and protected. If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, you can contact Lexi as outlined in the Privacy Policy.

## 14. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

### 14.1. Informal Resolution: 
If you have any concerns or disputes with Lexi regarding VRConsole or these Terms, we encourage you to contact us first to try to resolve the issue informally. You can reach out via the support contact (e.g., Patreon messaging or email as provided) and provide a brief description of your issue. We will attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally.

### 14.2. Binding Arbitration: 
If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, *you and Lexi agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to VRConsole or these Terms (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof) shall be determined by binding arbitration, rather than in court. This applies to any and all claims except that either party may bring claims in small claims court if they qualify.

Arbitration Procedures: The arbitration will be administered by a neutral arbitration organization (for example, the American Arbitration Association (AAA) if in the US, or a comparable international arbitration body if you are outside the US) and conducted under that organization’s rules applicable to consumer disputes. You agree that you are waiving the right to a trial by judge or jury in a public court. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

Location: The arbitration hearings (if any, as most decisions may be rendered on documents or online) shall be held in a location to be determined at Lexi's sole discretion. You may request to participate by telephone or video to the extent the arbitral rules allow. We aim to make the process fair and not overly burdensome.

Individual Basis Only: You and Lexi agree that any arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class actions, collective arbitrations, private attorney general actions, or any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not permitted. The arbitrator may only award relief (monetary, injunctive, declaratory) in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

Exceptions – IP Protection and Court Orders: Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief (a court order) in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property rights or to prevent unauthorized use or abuse of VRConsole (for example, stopping someone from distributing infringing copies of the software), without first engaging in arbitration. Additionally, claims that are not subject to arbitration by law (in some jurisdictions certain claims may not be arbitrable) can be resolved in court as appropriate.

### 14.3. Governing Law: 
These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or VRConsole shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Lexi’s jurisdiction** (for example, the State of California, USA, or if Lexi is outside the USA, the applicable laws of Lexi’s country of residence),* without regard to its conflict of law principles, except to the extent that U.S. federal law (if applicable) or other applicable international law provides otherwise. If you are a consumer in the EU or another jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protections, this choice of governing law applies only to the extent that it does not deprive you of any protection afforded by such mandatory laws.

### 14.4. Arbitration Finality and Enforcement: 
The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. In other words, once an arbitrator issues a ruling, either party can take that ruling to a court to have it recognized and enforced if the other party does not comply.

### 14.5. Fees: 
Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with the arbitration rules (with the understanding that the arbitrator may reallocate fees in the award as provided by those rules or applicable law). If the cost of arbitration would be prohibitive compared to court, Lexi will pay that portion of the administrative fees necessary to ensure the arbitration proceeds (but not attorney’s fees for you).

### 14.6. 30-Day Opt-Out: 
You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement, but you must do so within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. To opt out, you must send a written notice to Lexi (via the provided contact information) with your clear intent to opt out of arbitration. The notice must include your name, contact information, and a statement that you opt out of the arbitration clause. If you opt out, you will not be bound by the arbitration or class action waiver provisions, but all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of arbitration has no effect on any previous or other arbitration agreements you may have with us. (If you are reading this and have passed the 30-day window, you cannot opt out and are bound by this clause.)

### 14.7. Future Changes to Arbitration Clause: 
If we make any future change to this arbitration section (other than a change to the contact address for opting out), you have the right to reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change. By rejecting a new change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the language of this provision as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

## 15. Miscellaneous Provisions

### 15.1. Entire Agreement: 
These Terms (along with the Privacy Policy referenced herein and any additional guidelines or terms provided within the VRConsole documentation or interface) constitute the entire agreement between you and Lexi regarding the use of VRConsole. They supersede any prior agreements, understandings, or communications (whether oral or written) between you and Lexi relating to VRConsole. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representation, warranty, or statement not expressly set out in these Terms.

### 15.2. Severability: 
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. In other words, the invalid part will be cut out or narrowed, and the rest of the agreement will still apply.

### 15.3. No Waiver: 
No failure or delay by Lexi in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof. Similarly, no single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other right, power, or privilege. If Lexi does not enforce a provision in some instance, that does not mean she waives her right to enforce it in the future.

### 15.4. No Assignment by You: 
You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations under this agreement to anyone else without our prior written consent. Any attempt to do so without consent is void. Lexi may assign or transfer this agreement (for example, if another person takes over development of VRConsole or in the event of any reorganization) as needed, and will notify users if such a change occurs. These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

### 15.5. No Third-Party Beneficiaries: 
These Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights. The agreement is between you and Lexi only. (For clarity: Even though VRChat or Patreon might be affected by how you use VRConsole, they are not parties to these Terms and have no obligations or rights hereunder.)

### 15.6. Relationship of Parties: 
You and Lexi are independent contracting parties. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and Lexi. You have no authority to bind Lexi or act on her behalf.

### 15.7. Headings and Interpretation: 
Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal effect. In interpreting these Terms, no ambiguity will be construed against the drafter (since both parties had opportunity to review). “Including” means “including without limitation.”

### 15.8. Contact Information: 
If you need to contact Lexi for any reason related to these Terms or VRConsole, you may do so by reaching out through the official communication channels provided (for example, sending a direct message on Lexi’s Patreon page or via the support email/contact listed on the VRConsole documentation). *At the time of this writing, the primary contact method is via Patreon.* Please refer to the Privacy Policy for additional contact details specifically for privacy inquiries.

### 15.9. Copyright Infringement/DMCA: 
Although VRConsole is closed-source and proprietary, if you believe VRConsole or any content within it infringes your intellectual property rights, you should notify Lexi with details of the alleged infringement. Lexi will investigate and respond as appropriate, complying with applicable intellectual property laws (including the DMCA for notices of copyright infringement).

### 15.10. Export Laws: 
VRConsole may be subject to export control laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all such laws and not to export, re-export, or use VRConsole in violation of any export embargoes, sanctions, or regulations. For example, you will not download or use VRConsole if you are in a country embargoed by the United States, and you will not provide VRConsole to individuals or entities on denial lists.

### 15.11. Acknowledgment: 
You acknowledge that you have read these Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by them. You also acknowledge that these Terms are a legally binding agreement and that, by accepting them, you are waiving certain legal rights, including the right to sue in court (subject to the arbitration clause above). If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us before using VRConsole.

Thank you for reading and for using VRConsole responsibly. We hope VRConsole enhances your VRChat experience, and we appreciate your support and understanding of the terms under which this personal project is offered.
