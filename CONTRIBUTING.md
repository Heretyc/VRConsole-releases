# VRConsole Unsolicited Ideas & Feedback Agreement

Effective January 25, 2026

(© 2026 Lexi. All rights reserved.)

## TL;DR (Summary)

### Free Ideas, No Strings: 
If you send Lexi (the developer of VRConsole) any idea, suggestion, or feedback, you're giving it to her for free. You won’t be paid or rewarded, and you won’t own any part of it afterward. It’s a voluntary donation of ideas on your part, with no expectation of compensation or benefit in return. Lexi may credit you, but makes no promise or guarantee to do so.

### Lexi Can Use or Ignore It: 
Lexi can use your suggestion, modify it, share it, or do nothing with it – entirely at her discretion. She doesn’t have to implement your idea or even reply to you about it. Once submitted, your idea belongs to Lexi to handle as she sees fit.

### No Partnership or Obligation: 
Sending in a suggestion does not make you a partner, employee, or contractor, and does not entitle you to any profit or credit even if the idea is used. You’re not entering a contract where you get something back – other than the satisfaction of helping out.

### Bottom Line: 
Don’t submit an idea if you expect any form of reward or ownership. By contributing ideas, you agree that Lexi owes you nothing in return. (If you’re not okay with that, please do not send in your ideas.) The legal terms below spell this out in detail.

# Terms for Unsolicited Idea Submissions (Full Agreement)

By voluntarily submitting any unsolicited idea, suggestion, feedback, or proposed feature (“submission”) to Lexi regarding the VRConsole software, you agree to the following terms:

Voluntary Submission – No Expectations: You acknowledge that your submission is entirely voluntary, unsolicited, and given without any expectation of payment, reward, ownership rights, or any other benefit. You waive any claim to compensation for your idea. In other words, once you submit an idea, it is effectively a gift to Lexi with no strings attached.

Becomes Lexi’s Property – License and Rights: You agree that any submission you provide can be treated as Lexi’s own property from the moment of submission. To the fullest extent allowed by law, you irrevocably assign and transfer to Lexi all rights, title, and interest in your idea. In case any rights in the submission do not automatically transfer, you hereby grant Lexi a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, and fully sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, display, perform, create derivative works from, or otherwise exploit the submission for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without further permission or compensation to you. This means Lexi has full rights to use or not use your idea however she sees fit, anywhere in the world, forever, and you will not own or control the idea anymore.

No Confidentiality: You agree that your submission is not confidential or proprietary. Lexi has no obligation to keep your idea secret and may freely disclose or share it with others if she wishes. You should not send any idea or material you consider private or patented. All unsolicited ideas are considered public and non-proprietary once submitted.

No Obligation to Use or Respond: Lexi is not obligated to review, implement, or respond to your submission. Sending an idea imposes no duty on Lexi to adopt it or even acknowledge it. She may simply ignore the submission or already have similar ideas under development. You understand that you might not receive any response, feedback, or acknowledgment regarding your idea, and that Lexi cannot guarantee that your submission hasn’t been considered or developed independently by herself or others already.

Lexi’s Discretion to Modify: If Lexi does decide to use your suggestion, she may adapt, edit, or modify it in any manner. She can use all, part, or none of your idea in developing VRConsole or other projects. Lexi may also combine your idea with others or with her own ideas. You grant her the right to make any changes or improvements to your submission without any restriction. You will not have approval rights or input on how the idea is used.

No Compensation or Guaranteed Credit: You will not receive any money, royalties, or any form of compensation for your submission. Lexi will not owe you any financial reward or reimbursement, and you will not be entitled to attribution or recognition for the idea unless she chooses to do so voluntarily. Lexi may credit you at her sole discretion, but makes no promise or guarantee to do so. You also agree that Lexi is not required to notify you if your idea is used in some way.

No Partnership or Relationship Created: You understand and agree that by submitting an idea, no contract, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary, or employment relationship is created between you and Lexi. You are not becoming a contractor, co-developer, or agent of Lexi by virtue of your submission. The act of providing a suggestion is not an offer to enter into any business arrangement – it is understood as a gratuity. You have no rights to any profits or advantages that may come from Lexi’s use of the idea, and you cannot claim to be a co-creator of any Lexi products or features that may incorporate elements of your submission.

Warranty of Originality: (Just to protect both parties, please ensure this clause if needed.) By submitting an idea, you represent that you have the right to do so and that, to the best of your knowledge, your submission does not infringe anyone else’s rights. You confirm that you are the original author of the suggestion or otherwise have permission to share it. (If you’re not sure you have the rights to an idea, do not submit it.) This Agreement does not permit you to violate any confidentiality obligations or intellectual property rights you might owe to others.

Global Applicability and Governing Law: This Agreement is intended to be valid and enforceable worldwide. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, all terms herein will apply to your submission regardless of your country of residence. For clarity, the laws of the State of California, USA will govern these terms and any dispute arising from your submission or this Agreement, except that if you reside in a jurisdiction with laws that mandatorily require another body of law (such as your local laws) to apply, those local laws will govern to the minimum extent required by law. In other words, we will abide by any non-waivable consumer rights or regulations in your country. This Agreement does not limit any of Lexi’s rights under applicable law.

– Jurisdiction: By submitting an idea, you agree that any dispute or claim related to your submission or these terms will be resolved under the governing law above. Unless prohibited by local law, you consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that governing region (e.g., the state or province of Lexi’s residence or business) for resolving any disputes.

– Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court or authority, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted, and if necessary deemed severed from the Agreement, not affecting the validity of the rest of the terms. The remaining provisions will continue in full force. Any invalid or unenforceable term will be replaced by a valid term that comes closest to the original intent and economic effect.

No Waiver: Lexi’s failure to enforce any part of these terms in a particular instance does not waive her right to enforce it in the future. No express or implied waiver of any term shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of that term or any other term.

Integration with Terms of Service: This Unsolicited Ideas & Feedback Agreement is part of, and supplemental to, [VRConsole’s Terms of Service](https://github.com/Heretyc/VRConsole-releases/blob/main/TERMS.md). It is meant to fit within the existing legal structure governing the use of VRConsole. In the event of any conflict between these specific idea submission terms and the general Terms of Service, these terms will govern with respect to the treatment of unsolicited ideas and feedback. By submitting any idea or feedback, you confirm that you have read and agree to both this Agreement and the VRConsole Terms of Service in their entirety.

### By proceeding to submit an idea or feedback to Lexi, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Agreement, and you agree to all of the above terms. If you do not agree, please do not send any unsolicited ideas or suggestions.
